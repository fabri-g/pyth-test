### Oracle tests

This repository contains the main contract designed to interface with the Pyth oracle. It includes functionality to test the primary operations of the Pyth contract through cross-contract calls. 

Additionally, the repository features two scripts that facilitate direct interactions with the Pyth contract using the NEAR CLI. 
These scripts are intended to demonstrate and validate the core functionalities of the Pyth oracle within the NEAR protocol ecosystem.
